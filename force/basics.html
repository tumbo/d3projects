/* 100 points created, and classified into one of 4 groups (focal points)
   a 5th focal point serves as the center, and collects a 5th group of nodes
   upon each iterval, nodes are randomly assigned to a different group. if it happens
   to be the center group, they stay there. there's something like a 1/5 chance
   of getting assigned here. Now, only the nodes that are not in this group
   need adjusted, so filter out center one


   FORCE DIRECTED LAYOUT
   Provides a mechanism for visualizing data with nodes and links that respond in a way
   which feels like there's a physical connection, or gravitational pull on the elements.

   We can have possibly two data sets, but really only the nodes are required

   Setup your force layout, and you get a bunch of defaults around gravity, fricion, charge

   You need to specify a size though, so the force layout knows what it has to work with.

   Then you pass the nodes, but you must call force.start() to "reheat" the layout simulation. It's interesting, because normally in layouts, you would call the layout once you've given enough parms for it to do its thing. So, instead of force(data), we have force.start(). Possibly because there are two potential data inputs

   Once done, the nodes data has had several fields appended...
   x - current x
   y - current y
   px - previous x
   py - previous y
   weight - number of assoicated links, if applicable
   fixed - boolean indicating if node position is locked

   running start() on initializing the force layout doesn't do much if the nodes()
   haven't been defined. After defining nodes, then you need to run start() again

   Each node object's x and y values are updated turning the tick()

   tick is one iteration of the force simulation. The simulation is updating data,
   but we need to re-express that data via .attr() and .style() or whatever. Thus, it's ideal to place the expression functionality inside the tick() method

   Note, default gravity of .1 results in center being focal point

   tick is all about tying into the simulation.

   Notice how we don't use d3 transitions here. The force tick effectively does this by running hundreds of times during the simulation.

   The timing of the simulation uses a parameter, alpha. alpha starts at 0.1
   it decreases slightly till reaching .005, then that simulation is over. You can run another by changing alpha, doing force.start()

   Also, if you attached a force.drag() to the svg nodes, this reheats or restarts the simulation... force.start().

  so to recap basics... define force, and at least the size using viewport dimensions, also define data expression code inside "tick" and tell the force layout about it, then pass in the nodes, run the force start, and the nodes will render in the middle in a circle.
